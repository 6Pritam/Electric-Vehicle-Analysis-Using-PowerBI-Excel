📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Electric Vehicle (EV) data to uncover key insights about adoption trends, vehicle performance, and regional distribution. The data was preprocessed using Excel and transformed with Power Query, followed by the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize and explore business insights dynamically.

🔎 Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to provide a clear view of EV adoption and performance by addressing:

🚘 Total Vehicles – Number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) & Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)

🔋 Average Electric Range – To analyze EV efficiency and technological growth

📊 Trends by Model Year – Understanding adoption patterns over time

🌍 Geographical Distribution – Count of EVs by city & state

🏷️ Vehicles by Make & Model – Identifying leading manufacturers and popular models

✅ CAFV Eligibility – Evaluating vehicles based on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility criteria

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Excel – Data cleaning & preprocessing

Power Query – Data transformation & modeling

Power BI – Interactive visualizations and dashboard creation

📊 Dashboard Highlights

KPI cards displaying Total Vehicles, Avg Electric Range, BEVs, PHEVs

Line & bar charts for Vehicle Adoption Trends by Model Year and City

Treemap for Vehicles by Model

Comparative insights of BEV vs PHEV share

Pie chart for CAFV Eligibility status
